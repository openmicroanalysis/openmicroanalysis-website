Microscopy and Microanalysis 2017 symposium A04
-----------------------------------------------

Dear colleagues,

Paper submission for the Microscopy and Microanalysis 2017 Annual Meeting (St. Louis, MO, 6-10 August, 2017) is now open, and will close on 21 February. My co-conveners and I would like to draw your attention to: Symposium A04, Advances in programming of quantitative microscopy for biological and materials science. We are looking for submissions dealing with showcasing programs written by microscopists for their particular biological and materials applications, at encouraging the community to write or contribute to existing programs, and at promoting collaborative work that will allow the development of new ideas and projects in microanalysis. A full description of this session is included below. Papers may be submitted via the `M&M2017 website <http://www.microscopy.org/mandm/2017/>`_

We are also pleased to announce the invited speakers for this symposium: 
- Nicholas Ritchie, NIST
- Francisco de la Pena, Cambridge University
- Ivan Bota, Antwerpen University
- Marc De Graef, Carnegie Mellon University
We are very excited to hear from these experts on software and codes, and we look forward to hearing about your work as well. See you in St. Louis!
The organizers of Symposium A04: Hendrix Demers McGill University and Philippe T. Pinard Oxford Instruments NanoAnalysis.

Symposium Description: 
Cutting-edge quantitative analyses do not only require state-of-the-art instruments but also innovative programs to collect and analyze data. The development of programs, scripts, and libraries opens the door to new applications of microanalysis, helps solve more challenging and important problems, and promotes the advancement of microscopy. This symposium aims at showcasing programs written by microscopists for their particular biological and materials applications, at encouraging the community to write or contribute to existing programs, and at promoting collaborative work that will allow the development of new ideas and projects in microanalysis. Contribution in the following categories and related subjects are welcome.

Topics of interest include:
- Quantitative microscopy simulation codes (Monte Carlo, multi-slice, block waves)
- Open source libraries (programming practices, community projects)
- Practical biological and materials applications of these programs in the SEM, EPMA, TEM/STEM, AEM

Sincerely,
Hendrix and Philippe

Microscopy and Microanalysis 2015 meeting in Portland
-----------------------------------------------------

A 2nd meeting about the openmicroanalysis project was in Portland 
during the `M&M 2015 <http://www.microscopy.org/MandM/2015/>`_.

European Microbeam Analysis Workshop 2015 in Portoroz
-----------------------------------------------------

A first meeting was held in Portoroz on Tuesday Tuesday May 5th 2015 after the second day of the `EMAS <https://www.microbeamanalysis.eu/events/event/6-emas-2015-14th-european-workshop-on-modern-developments-and-applications-in-microbeam-analysis>`_ workshop.
It attracted approximately 25 participants. 
A short :download:`presentation <_static/event/emas2015.pdf>` of the project was presented by Hendrix Demers, Raynald Gauvin, Philippe Pinard and Silvia Richter.
The meeting allowed both users and companies to express their first opinions and suggestions about this project.
